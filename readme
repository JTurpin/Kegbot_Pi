KegPi by Jim Turpin and Aaron Ott

Contained in here is the 3 pieces of code required to keep tabs on the AppliedTrust Kegerator.

1) check.php used by apache to display the keg temps and percentages of kegs left. This is handy for scraping by kegpad, nagios, cacti, etc

2) KegPi\KegPi.pde - The arduino sketch responsible for monitoring temps and flows

3) kegbot.py - The python code running on the Pi to monitor serial communications from the arduino. This script is also responsible for updating the values in the kegstats.txt file

Check_Kegbot.sh - quick script for cron to determine if the python app is running and if not to restart it.

kegsizes.txt - used by check.php to display percentages (a 5 gallong keg = 115200 pulses from the flow meter)

kegstats.txt - comma seperated list of values. temp1, temp2, pulses left for keg1, pulses left for keg 2
